# LoRa-Communication-Project
A hardware Project used for long-range Communication <br>
In this project, a long-range IoT communication system using LoRa SX1278 modules and Arduino enables real-time transmission of environmental data (temperature, humidity, gas detection, and distance) from an automated vehicle to a remote receiver over a 10 km range. Designed and programmed sensor integration, autonomous navigation, and remote device control, demonstrating expertise in IoT, wireless communication, and embedded systems.

The Overall details of the project are provided in the file Ideal_Lab_report document, which is a total report on the project.
