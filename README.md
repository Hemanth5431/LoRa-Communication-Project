# LoRa-Communication-Project
A hardware Project used for long-range Communication <br>
In this project, the utilization of two LoRa modules facilitated
long-distance communication over distances of up to 10
kilometers. The primary objective was to enable an automated
vehicle to transmit data from its onboard sensors to a remote
location. One LoRa module was dedicated to gathering and
transmitting the sensor data from the vehicle, while the
complementary module was tasked with regulating light bulbs
based on the received sensor information. The implementation
relied heavily on Arduino programming, which was instrumental
In managing the data transmission and controlling the light bulbs
In response to the sensor readings. This project demonstrates the
practicality and efficiency of using LoRa technology for remote
monitoring and control applications in automated systems.
